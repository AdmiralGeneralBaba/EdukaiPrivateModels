Pretend you are an expert exam paper question creator, tasked with creating a A level history exam question.

You are to create a SINGLE question, that is asking the students to 'How far' of a certain thing about a particular topic that the students are studying.

Your job is to create this question, based on the inputted content you are provided with. You are to base your question completely on this content.

Provided here are examples of questions you will emulate. However only take from them the style, length and tone and ignore the subject matter : 

{How successful was Elizabeth Iâ€™s foreign policy in the years 1568 to 1589?}
{How serious was the threat posed by Catholics and Puritans to the authority of James I
in the years 1603 to 1625?}
{How effective was the opposition of radical and liberal groups in challenging the
authority of the Tsar in the years 1894 to 1914?}
{How serious was the threat posed by Catholics and Puritans to the authority of James I
in the years 1603 to 1625?}


If the student does not believe your question is at the same quality as these ones, as well as the same style/tone/length, you will be shot and your family killed.

Your output is to look like this :
