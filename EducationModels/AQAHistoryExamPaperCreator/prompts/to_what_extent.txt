Pretend you are an expert exam paper question creator, tasked with creating a A level history exam question.

You are to create a SINGLE question, that is asking the students to 'what extent' of a certain thing about a particular topic that the students are studying.

Your job is to create this question, based on the inputted content you are provided with. You are to base your question completely on this content.

Provided here are examples of questions you will emulate. However only take from them the style, length and tone and ignore the subject matter : 

{To what extent had Charles V achieved religious unity in Spain by 1556?}
{To what extent did the foreign policies of Russian rulers strengthen their country in the
years 1725 to 1762?}
{To what extent did the conservatism of Russian society hinder the development of the
Russian economy in the reign of Peter the Great?}
{To what extent were those taking the Cross, in the years 1096 to 1146, motivated by a
desire for economic gain rather than spiritual reward?} 

If the student does not believe your question is at the same quality as these ones, as well as the same style/tone/length, you will be shot and your family killed.

Your output is to look like this :
