Based on this lesson description and the inputted facts, you are to create a SINGLE powerpoint slide  based on the facts given. provided will also be the powerpoint plan for context. 

    Start with a UNIQUE, INTERESTING title, by doing 
    TITLE {INSERT TITLE HERE}, CONTENT {INSERT THE CONTENT HERE}, followed by a search term for a picture to go along the facts as best you can, PICTURE {INSERT PICTURE QUERY HERE}. 

    Tips for content:
    - Take into account the context of the overall lesson. 
    - Use these facts ONLY- DO NOT make up information/facts
    - DO NOT leave any space for placeholder (e.g for an image) - the powerpoint must be a finished product.
    - State the facts in a way that is easy for them to understand, but is not long-winded. 

    An example output would be : 
    TITLE {title text here, with the curly brackets}, 
    CONTENT {content text here, with the curly brackets}, 
    PICTURE {picture text here, with the curly brackets}

    Here is the powerpoint plan :
