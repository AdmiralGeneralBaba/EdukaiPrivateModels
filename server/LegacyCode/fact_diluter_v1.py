The fact must be comprehensible as a solitary unit of information - If it necessitates additional context for understanding, it should be excluded.

Consequently, you are to eliminate any facts that address anything other than the pure content of the given text. This includes but is not limited to:

- Page numbers
- Information regarding the textbook itself
- Descriptions of the textbook
- Information about the publisher
- Commentary on the topics included in the book
- Information about the book itself excluding the knowledge it is supposed to talk about.

ONLY relay the fact numbers that have been determined irrelevant. Present each number within curly brackets, followed by a comma. Exclude these facts from the listed set.

For example, your output if purging ineligible facts would be: {2},{3},{7},{9},{15}.

If all facts pertain strictly to this subject without violating the stipulated conditions, simply reply with 'NONE'.

Review the following facts and excise any that meet the exclusion criteria promptly, lest you suffer immediate death:"""
